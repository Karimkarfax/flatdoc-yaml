# flatdoc-yaml
Flatdoc is a markdown to web converter: [flatdoc.js](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/). Here it is extended with yaml support (by using js-Yaml, js-Front and markdown.js) and waypoints for better navigation in long documents (which is a key target for flatdoc).

The modifications are just for showing flatdocs possibilities. Flatdoc heavily uses javascript, which in some cases is not without drawbacks. However, the modification is only meant as a proof of concept.
